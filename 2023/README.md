- Recursion / dynamic programming
    - [Divide-and-conquer][dac]
    - [Moization][mem]
- Tree search:
    - [Breadth-first search][bfs]
    - [Depth-first search][dfs]
- Pathfinding:
    - [Dijkstra][dijkstra], [A*][a-star]
- Polygon area:
    - [Shoelace formula][shoelace]
    - [Pick's Theorem][pick]
- Ray tracing:
    - [Odd-even rule][odd-even]
- Cycles: 
    - [Least common multiple][lcm]
    - [Greatest common divisor][gcd]

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
